The TSODBG can be installed from GitHub:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("spcspin/TSODBG", dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

## Main functions

- `TSODBG`: Function for discover the best genotypes.

## Example dataset
The test dataset provided in this package is the tropical rice dataset which was published by Spindel et al. (2015) <doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004982>.
